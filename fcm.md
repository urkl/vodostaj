# Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Setup Instructions

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that allows you to reliably send push notifications to Android, iOS, and web applications. This document provides step-by-step instructions to configure FCM for your project and integrate it with your Vaadin application.
